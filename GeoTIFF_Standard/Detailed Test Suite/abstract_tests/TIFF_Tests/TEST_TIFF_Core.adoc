*Purpose:* Verify that the GeoTIFF file conforms to the TIFF specification.

*Pre-conditions:* None

*Test Variables:* None

*Test Process:*

There is no authoritative conformance test for TIFF 6.0.
The best that can be achieved is to use a TIFF reference implementation to sucessfully read a GeoTIFF file.
The OGC will provide such a reference implementation based on the open source LibTIFF library (https://gitlab.com/libtiff/libtiff).

Once TIFF 6.0 confirmance has been validated, execute test TIFF_Tests/TIFF.Tags.
