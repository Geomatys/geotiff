[big]*i.     Abstract*

This profile specifies the requirements and encoding rules for using the Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) for the exchange of georeferenced imagery. It formalizes the existing community standard for the
Geographic Tagged Image File Format (GeoTIFF) file format.

[big]*iii.   Preface*

The GeoTIFF format was initially developed during the early 1990â€™s (N. Ritter & Ruth, 1997) in order to leverage a mature platform independent file format (TIFF) by adding metadata required for describing and using geographic image data. TIFF met the requirements for an underlying format, as it was lossless and extensible. In September 1994, SPOT Image Corp proposed a GeoTIFF structure that was limited to Universal Transverse Mercator (N. Ritter & Ruth, 1997). The proposed GeoTIFF specification has augmented and formalized by Niles and Ruth as Revision 1.0, specification version 1.8.2 in November 1995 (N. Ritter & Ruth,1995). This specification is currently the official GeoTIFF specification (GeoTIFF, n.d).

The GeoTIFF format is used throughout the geospatial and earth science communities to share geographic image data. That usage inevitably leads to identification of new requirements and needs for profiles, extensions, and improvements to the original GeoTIFF Specification. The OGC is well established as a forum for standardization in the GeoTIFF producer and user communities and, as such, it provides an inclusive standardization process for those communities. This document is the first step in the process of integration of the GeoTIFF into that standardization process, with the adjustment of a minor revision in order to allow the use of modern EPSG register, allowing backward compatibility with Revision 1.0. Once GeoTIFF is ensconced in the OGC, the standard can be evolved using a formal process.
