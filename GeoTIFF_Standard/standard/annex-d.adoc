== Recommendations for describing compound and geographic 3D CRSs
(Informative)

=== Compound CRSs
A future version of GeoTIFF may expand the values of the GTModelTypeGeoKey to explicitly describe the Model CRS being compound. This document does not do that.

Recommendation: For a 2D+1D compound CRS comprised of projected CRS + vertical CRS,  GTModelTypeGeoKey value should be 1 and both a ProjectedCRSGeoKey and a VerticalCRSGeoKey should be given. The ProjectedCRSGeoKey should describe a 2D projected CRS.

Recommendation: For a 2D+1D compound CRS comprised of geographic 2D CRS + vertical CRS,  GTModelTypeGeoKey value should be 2 and both a GeodeticCRSGeoKey and a VerticalCRSGeoKey should be given. The GeodeticCRSGeoKey should describe a geographic 2D CRS.

Note: a possible long-term solution would be to assign a GTModelTypeGeoKey value of 4 to indicate a compound CRS comprised of projected CRS + vertical CRS, and value of 5 to indicate a compound CRS comprised of geographic 2D CRS + vertical CRS. These are not valid values in this specification.

=== Geographic 3D CRS
A future version of GeoTIFF may expand the values of the GTModelTypeGeoKey to explicitly differentiate between geographic 2D and geographic 3D CRSs. This document does not do that.
In this document there are several possible means of describing a geographic 3D CRS:

a) give GTModelTypeGeoKey value of 2 and identify a geographic 3D CRS through the GeodeticCRSGeoKey. The VerticalCRSGeoKey is not populated.

b) give GTModelTypeGeoKey value of 2 and identify a geographic 3D CRS through the GeodeticCRSGeoKey, plus identify the ellipsoidal height unit through a GeogLinearUnitGeoKey. The VerticalCRSGeoKey is not populated.

c) give GTModelTypeGeoKey value of 2 and identify a geographic 2D CRS through the GeodeticCRSGeoKey, plus identifying the geographic 3D CRS through the VerticalCRSGeoKey.

d) give GTModelTypeGeoKey value of 2 and use the VerticalCRSGeoKey to describe an ellipsoid from which the ellipsoid height is measured using the GeoTIFF v1.0 codes in Table D.1 below.
Note: This option is documented only for compatibility with some past Community practices. In this document a 1D ellipsoidal height is an invalid concept and use of these codes is deprecated.

e) give GTModelTypeGeoKey value of 2 and use the GeodeticCRSGeoKey to describe a geographic 2D CRS, giving the geographic 3D CRS description through the VerticalCRSGeoKey. The geographic 2D CRS should be the horizontal component of the geographic 3D CRS.

None of these are long-term solutions. Until a revision of this specification is available, recommended practice for writers is to use (e). Readers should be prepared for any of these options.

Note: a possible long-term solution would be to assign a GTModelTypeGeoKey value of 6 to indicate a geographic 3D CRS, with the VerticalCRSGeoKey not populated (modification of (a) above). This is not a valid value in this specification.
