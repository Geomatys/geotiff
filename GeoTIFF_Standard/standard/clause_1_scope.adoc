== Scope
This OGC**Â®** Standard defines the Geographic Tagged Image File Format (GeoTIFF) file format and the requirements to which every GeoTIFF file must adhere.
GeoTIFF defines a set of TIFF tags provided to describe all "Cartographic" information associated with TIFF imagery that originates from satellite imaging systems, scanned aerial photography, scanned maps, digital elevation models, or as a result of geographic analyses. Its aim is to allow means for tying a raster image to a known model space or earth-based coordinate reference system, and for describing those coordinate reference systems.

The tags documented in this specification are to be considered completely orthogonal to the raster-data descriptions of the TIFF specification, and impose no restrictions on how the standard TIFF tags are to be interpreted, which color spaces or compression types are to be used, etc.

This minor revision of GeoTIFF focuses on updating the current GeoTIFF community specification and aligning it with current OGC standardization practice, as well as enabling the use of coordinate reference systems that have been included in EPSG register since the GeoTIFF 1.0 specification dating from 1995. It should therefore be backward compatible with the 1.0 version, both for coordinate reference systems based on EPSG register codes, or user-defined coordinate reference systems. <<annex-h.adoc#,Backward compatibility>> documents this backward compatibility and evolutions of this revision 1.1.
