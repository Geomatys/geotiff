== Scope
This OGC**Â®** Standard defines the Geographic Tagged Image File Format (GeoTIFF)  by specifying the content and structure of a group of industry-standard tag sets for the management of georeferenced or geocoded raster imagery using Aldus-Adobe's publicly available Tagged Image File Format (TIFF). This OGC Standard specifies the requirements to which every GeoTIFF file shall adhere.

GeoTIFF defines a set of TIFF tags provided to describe all "Cartographic" information associated with TIFF imagery that originates from satellite imaging systems, scanned aerial photography, scanned maps, digital elevation models, or as a result of geographic analyses. The goal is to provide a consistent mechanism for referencing a raster image to a known model space or earth-based coordinate reference system and for describing those coordinate reference systems.

The tags documented in this standard are to be considered completely orthogonal (i.e., independent) to the raster-data descriptions of the TIFF specification, and impose no restrictions on how the standard TIFF tags are to be interpreted, which color spaces or compression types are to be used, and so forth.

This OGC Standard is a minor revision of GeoTIFF focused on updating the current GeoTIFF community specification and aligning it with current OGC standardization practice. This includes enabling the use of coordinate reference systems that have been included in EPSG register since the GeoTIFF 1.0 specification dating from 1995. As such, the OGC GeoTIFF Standard should be backward compatible with the 1.0 version, both for coordinate reference systems based on EPSG register codes, or user-defined coordinate reference systems. <<annex-h.adoc#,Backward compatibility>> documents this backward compatibility and the evolutions of the 1.1 revision.
