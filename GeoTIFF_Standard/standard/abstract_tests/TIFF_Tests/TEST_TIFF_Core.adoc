*Purpose:* Verify that the GeoTIFF file conforms to the TIFF specification.

*Pre-conditions:* None

*Test Variables:* None

*Test Process:*

There is no authoritative conformance test for TIFF 6.0. The best that can be achieved is to use a TIFF reference implementation to successfully read a GeoTIFF file. The OGC recommends the use of tiffdump based on the open source LibTIFF library (https://gitlab.com/libtiff/libtiff) for dumping the content of TIFF tags (displaying error messages if any), or opensource TIFF file validator (such as the JHOVE tool, opensource developed in Java - cf. http://jhove.openpreservation.org/).

Once TIFF 6.0 confirmance has been validated, execute test TIFF_Tests/TIFF.Tags.
