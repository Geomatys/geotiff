<|Test purpose: | Verify all GeoKeys who's values are of type double
2+<|Test method:
2+<| 1) Validate and process the TIFF header +
 a) Verify that Bytes 0-1 = 0X4949 ("II" = little endian) or 0X4D4D ("MM" = big endian) +
 b) Verify that Bytes 2-3 = the short integer value 42 intepreted using the byte order specified in bytes 0-1 +
 c) Bytes 4-7 are the offset to the first Image File Directory. Save this value as IFD_Offset.
 d) While the IFD_Offset is not 0 {
 perform test 2
 IFD_Offset = the last four bytes of the current IFD}
 Done

|Test id: | A.1.1
|Requirement: |http://www.opengis.net/spec/GeoTIFF/0.0/TIFF
|Test purpose: | Verify that the subject component is compliant with the TIFF 6.0 specification.
|Test method: | Validate and process the TIFF header; Bytes 0-1 = 0X4949 ("II" = little endian) or 0X4D4D ("MM" = big endian), Bytes 2-3 = the short integer value 42 intepreted using the byte order specified in bytes 0-1, Bytes 4-7 = the offset to the first Image File Directory.

Wile the IFD offset is not 0, perform test 2, offset = the last four bytes of the IFD

Test 2:
Bytes 0-1 of the IFD are a short integer indicating the number of Entries that are in the IFD. The first entry starts at byte 2. Do for each entry: Bytes 0-1 contain the TIFF tag value.
IF   Then execute test -- against the IFD entry
IF   Then execute test
IF   Then execute test

|Test id: | A.1.2
|Requirement: |http://www.opengis.net/spec/GeoTIFF/0.0/DataGeoTags
|Test purpose: | Verify that subject component correctly produces and/or consumes GeoTIFF specific information using the specified reserved TIFF tags
|Test method: | Parse a GeoTIFF file, writing out each TIFF tag in the order that they are encountered.  Inspect the output for the proper use of reserved TIFF tags.

|Test id: | A.1.3
|Requirement: |http://www.opengis.net/spec/GeoTIFF/0.0/DataTypes
|Test purpose: | Verify that all of the data-types required for GeoTIFF are supported by the subject component
|Test method: | Differs for Producers vs. Consumers of GeoTIFF
|  Producers: | Inspect a sampling of GeoTIFF files produced by the subject component and validate that all of the TIFF 6.0 tag data-types are used.
|  Consumers: | Create a sample GeoTIFF file which includes TIFF 6.0 tags using all of the TIFF 6.0 tag data-types. Pass this file as input to the subject component and check for errors.

|Test id: | A.1.4
|Requirement: |http://www.opengis.net/spec/GeoTIFF/0.0/ByteOrder
|Test purpose: | Verify that the subject component properly handles the 'byte-order' indicator.
|Test method: | Differs for Producers vs. Consumers of GeoTIFF
|  Producers: | Inspect a sampling of GeoTIFF files produced by the subject component and validate that byte ording of those files agrees with the 'byte-order' indicator.
|  Consumers: | Create two sample GeoTIFF files, one using big-endian and the other small-endian byte-ordering. Pass these files as input to the subject component and check for errors.

|Test id: | A.1.5
|Requirement: |http://www.opengis.net/spec/GeoTIFF/0.0/TagSort
|Test purpose: | Verify that the subject component encodes and/or processes TIFF tags in ascending order
|Test method: |Parse a GeoTIFF file, writing out each TIFF tag in the order that they are encountered.  Inspect the output for proper ordering.

|Test id: | A.1.6
|Requirement: |http://www.opengis.net/spec/GeoTIFF/0.0/GeoKeySort
|Test purpose: | Verify that the subject component encodes and/or processes GeoTIFF key-IDs in ascending order
|Test method: | Parse a GeoTIFF file, writing out each Key-ID in the order that they are encountered.  Inspect the output for proper ordering.
