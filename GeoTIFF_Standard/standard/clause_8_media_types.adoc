== Media Types for any data encoding(s)
A section describing the MIME-types to be used is mandatory for any standard involving data encodings. If no suitable MIME type exists in http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/index.html then this section may be used to define a new MIME type for registration with IANA.

A GeoTIFF file is a TIFF file. It is common to use the tiff MIME type,	image/tiff	according to [RFC3302].
OGC GMLCOV GeoTIFF extension (OGC 12-100r1) specifies image/tiff as MIME identifier (cf. Requirement #5).
The recommendation for a specific MIME type such as image/tiff+geo, or image/tiff-geo is under consideration in this revision, and should be discussed within the OGC and the imagery communities.
