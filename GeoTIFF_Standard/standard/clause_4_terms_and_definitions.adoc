== Terms and Definitions
For the purposes of this document, the following additional terms and definitions apply.

=== band
range of wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation that produce a single response by a sensing device

 [Source: 19101-2:2018, 3.1]

Note: At the pixel level, a band is represented as one of the vector values of the pixel. At image level, band i of an image is the rectangular array of i^th^ sample values from the pixel vectors.

=== cell

 [Source: GeoTIFF Format Specification, October 31, 1995]

=== code
representation of a label according to a specified scheme

 [Source: ISO 19118:2011, 4.3]

=== coordinate
one of a sequence of numbers designating the position of a point

Note 1 to entry: In a spatial coordinate reference system, the coordinate numbers are qualified by units.

 [Source: ISO 19111:2019, 3.1.5]

=== coordinate reference system
coordinate system that is related to an object by a datum

Note 1 to entry:	 Geodetic and vertical datums are referred to as reference frames.

Note 2 to entry:	For geodetic and vertical reference frames, the object will be the Earth. In planetary applications, geodetic and vertical reference frames may be applied to other celestial bodies.

 [Source: ISO 19111:2019, 3.1.9]

NOTE: This term is also called Model Coordinate Reference system in the context of this document, and was called Model Coordinate system in the 1995 GeoTIFF v1.0.

set of mathematical rules for specifying how coordinates are to be assigned to points

 [Source: ISO 19111:2019, 3.1.11]

=== ellipsoid
__reference ellipsoid__

<geodesy> geometric reference surface embedded in 3D Euclidean space formed by an ellipse that is rotated about a main axis

Note 1 to entry: 	For the Earth the ellipsoid is bi-axial with rotation about the polar axis. This results in an oblate ellipsoid with the midpoint of the foci located at the nominal centre of the Earth.

 [Source: ISO 19111:2019, 3.1.22]

=== flattening
__f__

ratio of the difference between the semi-major (a) and semi-minor axis (b) of an ellipsoid to the semi-major axis; f = (a - b)/a

 [Source: ISO 19111:2019, 3.1.28]

=== geocoding
translation of one form of location into another

 [Source: ISO 19133:2005, 4.4]

NOTE: In the 1995 GeoTIFF v1.0, "an image is geocoded if a precise algorithm for determining the earth-location of each point in the image is defined".

=== geographic coordinate reference system
coordinate reference system that has a geodetic reference frame and an ellipsoidal coordinate system

 [Source: ISO 19111:2019, 3.1.35]

Note: This allows the assignment of a Latitude-Longitude vector to a location on earth (plus optionally a geodetic height).

NOTE: In the the 1995 GeoTIFF v1.0, this term was "geographic coordinate system"

=== geokey
in GeoTIFF, a GeoKey is equivalent in function to a TIFF tag, but uses a different storage mechanism

 [Source: GeoTIFF Format Specification, October 31, 1995]

=== georeferencing
geopositioning an object using a Correspondence Model derived from a set of points for which both ground and image coordinates are known

 [Source: ISO 19130:2010, 4.37]

NOTE: In the 1995 GeoTIFF v1.0, "An image is georeferenced if the location of its pixels in
some model space is defined, but the transformation
tying model space to the earth is not known".

=== GeoTIFF

standard for storing georeference and geocoding information in a TIFF 6.0 compliant raster file

 [Source: GeoTIFF Format Specification, October 31, 1995]

=== grid

network composed of two or more sets of curves in which the members of each set intersect the members of the other sets in an algorithmic way

Note 1 to entry: 	The curves partition a space into grid cells.

 [Source: ISO 19123:2005, 4.1.23]

=== imagery

representation of phenomena as images produced electronically and/or optical techniques

Note 1 to entry:	In this document, it is assumed that the phenomena have been sensed or detected by one or more devices such as radar, cameras, photometers, and infra-red and multispectral scanners

 [Source: 19101-2:2018, 3.14]

=== meridian

intersection of an ellipsoid by a plane containing the shortest axis of the ellipsoid

Note 1 to entry: 	This term is generally used the describe the pole-to-pole arc rather than the complete closed figure.

=== orthorectified grid
__orthoimage__

image in which by orthogonal projection to a reference surface, displacement of image points due to sensor orientation and terrain relief has been removed

Note 1 to entry:	The amount of displacement depends on the resolution and the level of detail of the elevation information and on the software implementation.

 [Source: 19101-2:2008, 3.25]

 georectified grid created using ground control points and elevation data where constant scale is maintained throughout the grid

line of constant latitude, parallel to the equator

=== projected coordinate reference system
coordinate reference system derived from a geographic coordinate reference system by applying a map projection

Note 1 to entry:  	May be two- or three-dimensional, the dimension being equal to that of the geographic coordinate reference system from which it is derived.

Note 2 to entry: 	In the three-dimensional case the horizontal coordinates (geodetic latitude and geodetic longitude coordinates) are projected to northing and easting and the ellipsoidal height is unchanged.

 [Source ISO 19111:2019, 3.1.51]

NOTE: In the the 1995 GeoTIFF v1.0, this term was "projected coordinate system"

=== projection

=== rectified grid
__georectified grid__

grid for which there is an affine transformation between the grid coordinates and the coordinates of an external coordinate reference system
